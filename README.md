# apple_style_stopwatch
This is a pretty simple version of a stopwatch based on the apple model,
it only includes start, stop and reset but I plan on making new versions with the lap function and some other cool stuff.
ItÂ´s made with HTML5, js and css only.
The way it works is that the start button triggers an interval that keeps running and adding to the variables (milliseconds, seconds, minutes)
until you hit stop, then the count stops and you can see the time, then if you press reset the count will go to 0.
Also it's meant to be used with a phone, so if you press f12 in your browser and select the phone display you will see how
it's actually supposed to look like.
